My background in start-ups and as a teacher has sharpened my ability to debug complex issues, communicate development standards, and mentor others effectively. I've worked in agile sprints, collaborated with designers using tools like Git and Figma, and consistently contributed to building efficient, scalable solutions while sharing knowledge in an accessible way.
